# Purpose: Determines how many lines of code will be written
#          before the coder crashes to sleep. Must be implemented
#          using recursion.
# Input: lines_before_coffee - how many lines of code to write before coffee
#        prod_loss - factor for loss of productivity after coffee
# Output: returns the number of lines of code that will be written
#         before the coder falls asleep

# Purpose: Uses a linear search to find the initial lines of code to
#          write before the first cup of coffee, so that the coder
#          will complete the total lines of code before sleeping AND
#          get to have coffee as soon as possible.
# Input: total_lines - lines of code that need to be written
#        prod_loss - factor for loss of productivity after each coffee
# Output: returns the initial lines of code to write before coffee

# Purpose: Uses a binary search to find the initial lines of code to
#          write before the first cup of coffee, so that the coder
#          will complete the total lines of code before sleeping AND
